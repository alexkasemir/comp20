##A collection of all my assignments completed in comp20:Web Programming##

By: Alex Kasemir

###Favorite Assignment###
My favorite Assignment was the mmap assignment where we used the Google Maps
API to display people's location on a map. This was my first exposure to the
Google APIs and I had never used "real" tools like this one when doing any web
programming. I felt like I was creating something that with a little more work
could actually be used in the real world. I was given tools that could actually
be used.

###The Journey###
I have grown a lot since day 1. I started with minimal knowledge on Web Applications.
I knew HTML and javascript, but I had only created very basic web applications that
most mirrored other applications. I hadn't really created anything from scratch
by myself. After this class, I feel like I could attack any web applications.
When I have my next creative burst, I feel like I will be able to make the 
application and be able to apply what I have learned and easily teach myself new
skills. My foot is in the door.

###Was it Worth it?###
I have grown, but how? The term "Web Programming" has taken on a new meaning for me.
Sure, I have learned how to create real and functioning web applications in javascript.
But I have also learned how to us the Web(the Internet) to facilitate my learning.
The Internet has so much information on tools that can be used and things that can
be done. If you want to do something, chances are you can find a place to start 
by asking the right question into stack overflow.

Another valuable bit of knownledge I gained in this class is the availablity of 
resources. JQuery exists, mongoDB exists, Node.js exists, the Google APIs are 
available. There are so many tools out there, and one simply needs to read the 
documentation to get a better understanding of what can or can't be done with that
tool. I have learned to explore.

###The Next Steps###
Creating web applications is cool and all, but I am really interested in seeing
how everything really works and the nuts and bolts behind websites. I have a vague
picture on how websites like Youtube, Facebook, etc, are created. However, I do 
not know exactly how they deal with such large loads of people on the website.
That is why I am taking Web Engineering ;).

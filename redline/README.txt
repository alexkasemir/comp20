1.	The google maps is displayed. However, the XML request was not able
	to be completed because the mbta had not enabled CORS. Therefore, real-time
	data could not be loaded onto the map in order to place markers where
	the trains are. The mbta is not on the same origin as the local file from 
	my computer.
2. 	Discussed with no one
3. 	4 hours, trying to figure out origin issue

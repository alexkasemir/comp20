<h1>Security Assessment of Marauder's Map</h1>

<p>Prepared by Alex Kasemir &bull; 12/5/2014</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment assesses the security of the Marauder's Map application from
the client side and the server side. The Marauder's Map Application was created 
by Saurav Acharya. The Marauder's Map App posts your location to a database with
a login and their location in latitude and longitude. I was hired to hack the 
web application and find as many vulnerabilities as I can  </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>First, some attacks were done without looking at the source code first. This
is called a "black-box" attack, and it is how most attacks would be done because
hackers do not have access to the source code. Then, some attacks were done with
access to the source code.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p>After doing the black box test, most of the security flaws have to do with
user input and allowing dangerous things for the user to do. The User can write
code to do dangerous things or other things to the input in order to mess up 
the data in some way. The user cannot be trusted and there should be security measures to
prevent them from "hacking" your application. </p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Location: In the SendLocation API</li>
<li><span class="high">High</span>: This is a highly dangerous because a hacker
could easily insert dangerous things into the application to make unwanted 
things happen. Data in not handled correctly.</li>
<li> Description: Data is not cleaned in any way so the user could input HTML or
    javascript code like: <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('poop')&lt;/script&gt;</code>).
    The code could be inserted into the application liek this: 
    <code>curl --data "login=&lt;iframe src='http://www.ecbmlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hacker.jpg'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;lat=1000000&amp;lng=1" localhost:3000/sendLocation</code>

<tr><td><img src="images/cross_site.png" alt="XSS hack" /></td>
<td><img src="images/cross_site_scripting.png" alt="hack" /></td></tr>
<td><img src="images/cross_site_alert.png" alt="hack" /></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>This could be avoided by cleaning up the data before it every gets to the
database. You would remove the dangerous characters from the input by potentially
using a regular expression</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Bad Input Data</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Location: using sendlocation </li>
<li><span class="mod">Moderate</span>: Data can't be trusted and it is not reliable</li>
<li>Description: The bad data is bad for the database right now. At the moment, the client can 
    simply put whatever they want into the latitude and longitude; it doesn't
    have to be a number. Also, the user can say that they are anywhere in the world
    and not their actaul location. This ruins the point of the application because 
    one's real location is not actually used and non-floating point numbers cannot be 
    displayed on the map. 

<table>
<tr><td><img src="images/notcleaned.png" alt="notcleaned data"/></td>
<td><img src="images/badinput.png" alt="GET crashes server"/></td>
 </tr>
</table></li>
<li>This could be resolved in two steps. One, the program should clean the data and 
makes sure it is the type of data that is wanted. This could be done by using the
<code>isFloat()</code> method. This would ensure that all the data passed in is 
actually a number that could be a latitude or longitude. The other thing that is important
is that the location that is sent is one's actual location. That way they cannot fake
their location. This could be done by making it only possible to send in your location
through the <code>navigator</code> object or GPS.</li>


</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Revealing all of database</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Location: In GET api, /locations.json</li>
<li><span class="high">High</span>: With a simple mongo command someone could
have access the entire contents of your database</li>
<li>Desctiption: Since the user input is not cleaned up in anyway. Someone can
    inject a mongo command into their GET request like this:
    <code>localhost:3000/locations.json?login[$ne]=poop</code> and they would
    reveal the contents of the database. Everyone else's data.
<table>
<tr><td><img src="images/scaryinput.png" alt="How to get database" /></td>
<td><img src="images/get_database.png" alt="gotten database" /></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p>This can be fixed again by checking the user input for some 
dangerous characters and not letting them be used. Also, they should just always
run the query the reveals one name in the database not let someone run an arbitrary 
mongo command on the database like the <code>[$ne]</code> When making requests. That way
someone cannot reveal the entire database to themselves. </p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Overloading database</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Location: In POST send location</li>
<li><span class="mod">Moderate</span>: Doing this can shutdown the server, but it would be
easily stopped.</li>
<li>Description: An evil user could do a few different things to overload the database.
    They could easily just repeatedly send in data over and over and over again by
    putting a curl command in a shell script and just running that script. Doing this could
    send massive amounts of data and fill up the database. This process could be sped up
    by inputting the binary or base64 of images and the usernames and lat and long to make 
    very large documents and fill up the database faster. 
<table >
<tr>
    <td><img src="images/overload.png" alt="overloading script"  /></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><p>The fix for this would be to 1. limit the length of a username and 2.
to limit the number of requests a single entity could send in a given time. That
way they cannot just repeatedly be send to crash the server</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>A lot of these flaws can be fixed by not trusting the user. People are evil
so you cannot expect them to do the right things. I am sure that there are more flaws
the application that are not immediately seen, and they could be found with a
tool like Burp Suite potentially, a more indepth look into the security of the app.
This costs $300 dollars a year and the security assessor would have to be compensated as well.
I would say that this would cost another $500 dollars. For a grand total of $800 to
protect the site against any cyber attacks. That way Anonymous can't get 'em.</p>
